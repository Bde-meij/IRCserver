A chat server following IRC protocols, created by mithras and me in C++
tested with IRC client "irssi"

how to use:
run 'make'
run ./ircServer "port" "password"
example: ./ircServer 1024 1234

a local server is now running and can communicate with any existing IRC - clients
open a new console and run "irssi" (might have to install irssi first, not sure)
(to stop and exit, type '/exit' in the irssi console)

if using irssi, connect with (in irssi console)
/connect localhost 1024 1234 nick

you can run multiple connections on one machine (in seperate consoles)
the first one to join or create a channel becomes operator
if operator(s) leave the room, the next 'oldest' becomes operator
if all users leave, the room is deleted

while connected, several commands can be used (in irssi console)
/nick 'newnickname'
/join 'roomname' (either joins existing or create new)
/part (leave current room)
/kick 'roomname' 'username' (if operator)
/topic 'roomtopicname' (set room topic, only if operator)

to simply say something in the room, type something without '/'
or do
/say "hello folks!"

/exit will completely stop and exit the irssi process
